# Smart-Parking-System
This project is a comprehensive web-based management portal for a Smart Parking System. It handles the entire user workflow, from secure authentication and real-time slot booking to billing management and operational forecasting. The application is built using a PHP/MySQL stack for robust backend processing.

✨ Key Features & Highlights
Secure User Authentication: Implemented a PHP/MySQL backend for secure user registration, login, and session management (login.php, get_user_data.php).

Auto-Allocation Booking System: Provides users with a responsive interface to select and reserve parking slots, incorporating client-side geolocation access for enhanced accuracy (booking.html).

Navigation & Confirmation: The booking confirmation page (confirmation.php) uses Leaflet.js and Leaflet Routing Machine to display the reserved spot and provide turn-by-turn directions from the user's current location.

Billing & Transaction History: A dedicated Billing dashboard (billing.html) allows users to view transaction history, filter payments, and view digital receipts.

Operational Forecasting: Features a Forecast dashboard (forecast.html) that uses Chart.js to visualize projected occupancy rates and usage trends.

Modern UI: Utilizes Tailwind CSS (seen in dashboard.html, billing.html) and Bootstrap for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface
